The game then generates images within a certain radius of the zipcode, and asks the player to guess the average Yelp rating of the restaurant based on images of their food. This is a full-stack app with a React.js frontend and a PostgreSQL backend. It was built in collaboration with Nick Lopez and Mily Wendland, two classmates from my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive cohort.",

      "This app was developed to help with one of my responsibilities as a high school wrestling coach. Each of the athletes earns a team jacket at the end of their first season. The jacket is then updated over their 4 years of high school with awards, honors, and championships. This site displays the students' current jackets next to their jackets after updated, and is meant to be used as a tool by the embroidery company. It was developed using the MERN stack, and the data for the jackets was converted from a CSV file to a Javascript seed file using a Python script.",
